# 71A - Way Too Long Words

The solution is just a straightforward implementation of the problem
statement. If the string length is greater than 10 characters, print
the first letter, the integer representing string length less 2 (the
first and last letters get printed no matter the string's length),
and, finally, the last letter.

Anything equals to or less than 10 characters long is copied to the
standard output without any modifications.
